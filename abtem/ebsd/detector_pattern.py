"""An EBSD pattern on a detector, calculated directly for one orientation.

:class:`~abtem.ebsd.reference.EBSDReferencePattern` calculates the whole
hemisphere, and :meth:`~abtem.ebsd.measurements.SphericalPattern.project` then
reads any detector out of it. When one orientation is all that is wanted -- a
defect, a strained region, a disordered specimen -- that is most of the
hemisphere calculated for nothing, and the detector's pixels are interpolated
from a grid usually coarser than they are. This goes the other way round: it
works out which directions the pixels look along in the crystal, and calculates
exactly those.

An orientation also fixes where the beam comes from, which a reference pattern
cannot know. So here the atoms can be lit as the beam really lights them.

    """One orientation's EBSD pattern on a detector, calculated by reciprocity.

    The single-orientation counterpart of
    :class:`~abtem.ebsd.reference.EBSDReferencePattern`: it takes the same
    detector geometry and Euler angles as
    :meth:`~abtem.ebsd.measurements.SphericalPattern.project`, and returns the
    same kind of image, but calculates each pixel's direction itself.

    The multislice is only accurate near a slab's axis, so the pixels are tiled
    into patches as a reference pattern tiles the hemisphere: each belongs to
    its nearest of ``n_patches`` zone axes, and is calculated in a slab cut
    along it. With the same `n_patches` and slab, and the uniform source, the
    result *is* the reference pattern at those pixels. Pixels looking into the
    crystal's southern hemisphere get patches of their own, along the negated
    axes, rather than an assumption that the crystal is centrosymmetric.

    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms : ase.Atoms or FrozenPhonons
        The crystal's unit cell, or an atomic model of the specimen, in its own
        frame. The Euler angles take the sample frame to this one. Give
        :class:`~abtem.FrozenPhonons` of either for thermal vibrations: every
        slab -- the incident beam's too -- is displaced configuration by
        configuration, and the pattern averaged over them, as for
        :class:`~abtem.ebsd.reference.EBSDReferencePattern`.
    geometry : EBSDGeometry
        Where the detector is, in EMsoft's conventions -- and where the beam
        comes in: along the microscope axis, at `geometry.sample_tilt` to the
        sample normal.
    euler : sequence of three float
        Bunge Euler angles ``(phi1, Phi, phi2)`` of the crystal.
    slab_cell : tuple of three float
        Dimensions of each slab [Å]; the third entry is the thickness along the
        beam. As for a reference pattern there is no default -- see
        :class:`~abtem.ebsd.reference.EBSDReferencePattern`.
    energy : float, optional
        Energy of the incident beam [eV]. Taken from the source when that is a
        wave, and required otherwise.
    source : 'uniform' or PlaneWave or Probe, optional
        How the incident beam lights the emitting atoms.

        ``'uniform'`` (default): evenly, as in a reference pattern and EMsoft.

        A :class:`~abtem.PlaneWave` or :class:`~abtem.Probe`: sent in along the
        beam's true direction, through a slab of its own cut from the same
        crystal about the same `origin`, recording how brightly it lights every
        atom the patches use. Channelling of the incident beam then picks out
        some atoms over others -- one sublattice over another in silicon, say.
        The depth at which an atom sits below that slab's entrance face is not
        its depth below the real surface, so the illumination is normalized
        within each of its slices: the beam decides which atoms are lit, and
        `depth_weight` how deep they count. A plane wave is what an SEM beam is
        on this scale; a probe can be scanned (see :meth:`build`).

        Both waves travel into the crystal as they do in the experiment: the
        beam down the microscope axis, and each pixel's reciprocity wave from
        the detector's side, against the electrons it collects -- in a slab
        cut along the opposite of the pixel's direction. So a crystal without
        an inversion centre shows each polar face where it really is.
    n_patches : int or None, optional
        Zone axes tiling each hemisphere, as for a reference pattern (default
        400, a patch radius of 132 mrad). Only the patches the pixels fall in
        are calculated. None calculates everything in one slab along the mean
        pixel direction -- cheaper, and fine for a narrow detector, but the
        edges of a wide one come out dim.
    degrees : bool, optional
        If True (default), `euler` is in degrees.
    sampling : float, optional
        Real-space sampling of the potentials [Å]. Defaults to
        :func:`~abtem.ebsd.reference.potential_sampling` for `atoms`; the
        angles of the pixels set no condition of their own.
    slice_thickness : float, optional
        Multislice slice thickness [Å] (default 1.0).
    repetitions : tuple of three int, optional
        Repetitions of `atoms` building the block every slab is cut from; see
        :func:`~abtem.ebsd.orientations.rotated_slab`. Pass ``(1, 1, 1)`` for
        an atomic model that already holds the feature of interest.
    origin : np.ndarray, optional
        Point of `atoms` at the centre of every slab -- the point every slab
        turns about, and that the incident beam passes through.
    backscatter_energy : float or sequence of float or BaseDistribution, optional
        Energies of the backscattered electrons [eV]; several add a leading
        energy axis, one detector image per energy. The beam keeps `energy`.
        See :class:`~abtem.ebsd.reciprocity.EBSD`.
    depth_weight, device :
        Passed to :class:`~abtem.ebsd.reciprocity.EBSD`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        scan : BaseScan or array of xy-positions, optional
            Positions of a probe source [Å], across the incident beam and
            measured from `origin`: one pattern each, as leading axes of the
            result.
        max_batch_directions : int or str, optional
            Directions propagated at once; passed to
            :meth:`~abtem.ebsd.reciprocity.EBSD.build`.
        lazy : bool, optional
            If True, return a pattern backed by a dask graph, with one task per
            patch. The incident beam, which every patch shares, is calculated
            first. Defaults to the abTEM configuration.
        pbar : bool, optional
            If True, show a progress bar over the patches.

        Returns
        -------
        pattern : EBSDPatternImages
            Of shape ``geometry.shape``, with leading axes for any probe
            positions -- the same kind of image
            :meth:`~abtem.ebsd.measurements.SphericalPattern.project` returns.
