class BackscatterDetector(CopyMixin, EqualityMixin):
    """The directions whose backscattered intensity an EBSD calculation collects.

    By reciprocity, each collected direction is simulated by launching a plane
    wave travelling in that direction into the crystal, so the "detector" is
    really a list of directions rather than something that converts an exit
    wave into a measurement.

    That is why this is **not** a :class:`~abtem.detectors.BaseDetector`.
    Backscattered intensity is not a function of an exit wave — it is a
    depth-resolved overlap of the source field with these back-propagated plane
    waves — so a detector of this kind cannot implement ``detect(waves)`` and
    must not be accepted by :meth:`abtem.Probe.scan`.

    The directions are stored as unit vectors rather than transverse
    wavevectors, because the transverse wavevector ``k0(E) * (dx, dy)`` depends
    on the energy while the direction does not. The same detector can therefore
    be reused across energies.

    Construct either from a regular grid of angles, by giving `max_angle` and
    `gpts`, or from an explicit list of `directions`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_angle : float, optional
        Half-width of the detector grid along each axis [mrad], measured as a
        scattering angle from the beam direction. The corner of the grid
        reaches a larger angle than this by up to a factor ``sqrt(2)``.
        Give together with `gpts`.
    gpts : int, optional
        Number of detector pixels along each axis of the grid. Give together
        with `max_angle`.
    directions : np.ndarray, optional
        Explicit unit vectors of shape ``(N, 3)`` in the frame of the slab,
        with ``z`` along the beam. Mutually exclusive with `max_angle` and
        `gpts`.
