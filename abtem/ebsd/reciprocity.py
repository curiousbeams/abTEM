"""EBSD patterns from multislice reciprocity.

The physical process is an electron entering the specimen, scattering
inelastically somewhere inside it, and leaving through the surface in some
direction. Simulating that directly would mean a separate calculation for every
scattering site. Reciprocity turns it around: the amplitude for an electron
generated at :math:`(\\mathbf{r}, z)` to leave in direction :math:`\\mathbf{k}`
equals the amplitude at :math:`(\\mathbf{r}, z)` of a plane wave travelling in
:math:`-\\mathbf{k}` that entered at the surface. One multislice run per
collected direction therefore covers every generation site at once.

The collected intensity for direction :math:`\\mathbf{k}` is

.. math::
    I(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\sum_z w_z \\sum_{\\mathbf{r}}
    |\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}, z)|^2 \\, s(\\mathbf{r}, z)}
    {\\sum_z w_z \\sum_{\\mathbf{r}} s(\\mathbf{r}, z)}

where :math:`\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}` is the reciprocity plane wave, :math:`s` is
where backscatter is generated, and :math:`w_z` is the probability that an
electron generated at depth :math:`z` escapes. The sums are incoherent: the
generation events are independent, so intensities add rather than amplitudes.

The source :math:`s` is the atoms (see :mod:`abtem.ebsd.emission`): each emits
in proportion to its cross-section for scattering straight back, as lit by the
incident beam. The ratio is the emission-weighted mean of the escape
probability, normalized once for the whole slab -- so a specimen that does not
scatter the plane waves gives :math:`I = 1` in every direction, the values are
yields relative to a featureless specimen, and nothing depends on how the atoms
fall into slices.

The reciprocity waves are carried as periodic envelopes. The multislice cell is
periodic, and a plane wave :math:`e^{2\\pi i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}`
fits it only when :math:`\\mathbf{k}` falls on the cell's reciprocal grid; in any
other direction it jumps in phase at the cell edge, and diffracts off the jump.
Written as :math:`e^{2\\pi i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} u(\\mathbf{r})`
-- Bloch's form -- the wave is carried by :math:`u`, which for a plane wave is
one everywhere, periodic whatever the direction. The transmission function
multiplies :math:`u` as it multiplies the wave, the propagator is the exact one
evaluated at :math:`\\mathbf{q} + \\mathbf{k}`, and the carrier has unit
modulus, so :math:`|u|^2` is the intensity. For a specimen that is periodic in
the cell -- a crystal, or a supercell holding a defect -- every direction is
then exact, and not only those on the grid; and a wave's direction no longer
uses up any of the antialias aperture, which limits only the scattering about it.

    The engine the pattern builders run in each of their slabs. It takes a slab
    already cut, and directions measured from its axis, and knows nothing of a
    sample, a beam or a detector: for a pattern on a real detector, from Euler
    angles and with the beam coming in from its true direction, see
    :class:`~abtem.ebsd.detector_pattern.EBSDDetectorPattern`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    potential : BasePotential or Atoms
        The specimen, built from atoms -- ``Atoms``,
        :class:`~abtem.FrozenPhonons`, or a :class:`~abtem.Potential` of either.
        The atoms are what emits, so a prebuilt ``PotentialArray``, which no
        longer carries them, will not do. The reciprocity waves travel along
        ``z``, so a slab should already be cut with the zone axis of interest
        along it (see :func:`abtem.ebsd.rotated_slab`).

        For the thermal cloud of the emitting atoms -- EMsoft's Debye-Waller
        factor -- build it from :class:`~abtem.FrozenPhonons`: the average over
        its configurations smears the emitters as it smears the scattering.
    detector : BackscatterDetector
        The directions to collect, in the slab's frame: the directions the
        reciprocity waves travel into it, ``+z`` being into the slab. The
        electrons they stand for leave the other way, so to collect the
        electrons leaving a crystal along ``d``, cut the slab along ``-d``;
        :class:`~abtem.ebsd.reference.EBSDReferencePattern` and
        :class:`~abtem.ebsd.detector_pattern.EBSDDetectorPattern` do.
    energy : float
        Energy of the incident beam [eV]. It sets the atoms' cross-sections,
        and the reciprocity waves' energy unless `backscatter_energy` does.
    illumination : np.ndarray, optional
        How brightly the incident beam lights each atom of the potential, of
        shape ``(atoms,)``, or ``(sources, atoms)`` for several at once, which
        become a leading axis of the result. Only the relative values matter.
        The atoms always emit, each by its cross-section for scattering
        straight back (see :mod:`abtem.ebsd.emission`); this says only how
        they are lit.

        By default all alike, as though the specimen were evenly illuminated --
        EMsoft's picture. Backscattered electrons come from tens of nanometres
        down, where the incident beam has long lost its direction, so the
        pattern is then a property of the specimen alone. Every atom in the cell
        emits, so for a specimen that is not a uniform crystal the pattern is
        the average over the cell.
        :class:`~abtem.ebsd.detector_pattern.EBSDDetectorPattern` passes the
        lighting of a beam from its true direction here.
    depth_weight : float or array or callable, optional
        How much the electrons generated at each depth count: the depth
        distribution of the backscattering events that end in the pattern.

        The elastic multislice algorithm is unitary, so the reciprocity plane
        waves carry no attenuation with depth on their own: without a weight,
        an event 200 Å deep counts as much as one just below the surface. Give
        a float to weight the depths by ``exp(-z / escape_depth)`` [Å], an array
        of one weight per slice, or a callable mapping an array of depths to
        weights. The weights are normalized to sum to one.

        An electron that lost more energy has, on the whole, come from deeper,
        so with several `backscatter_energy` the weights may depend on the
        energy: a callable of ``(depths, energy)``, or an array of one row per
        energy -- the depth distribution per energy bin of a Monte Carlo
        simulation, as EMsoft uses.

        The default, None, weights every depth equally. Thermal diffuse
        scattering along the way is the specimen's own physics: build it from
        :class:`~abtem.FrozenPhonons`. It damps the contrast but keeps the
        electrons; the smooth background of electrons whose paths ran far
        deeper than any slab is a Monte Carlo quantity this does not produce.
    backscatter_energy : float or sequence of float or BaseDistribution, optional
        Energy of the backscattered electrons [eV]. A backscattered electron
        has lost some of the beam's `energy`, so these must not exceed it.
        Giving more than one adds a leading :class:`.EnergyAxis` and costs
        proportionally more: the reciprocity waves travel at this energy, so
        each one needs its own wavelength, propagator and transmission
        function. Defaults to `energy`, the elastic case.

        The weights of a distribution are recorded in the metadata rather than
        applied, since summing the energy axis is the consumer's business and
        the weights usually come from a Monte Carlo spectrum.
    depth_tolerance : float, optional
        Stop propagating once the depth weight still to be collected falls
        below this fraction of the total (default 1e-4). Slices past a short
        escape depth carry no weight, and propagating them is the dominant
        cost. Has no effect under the default uniform weighting, where the
        remaining weight only vanishes at the last slice.

        The bound is on the *discarded weight*; the error in any one direction
        can be a few times that, because the slices dropped are not average
        ones. Set to 0 to disable.
    depth_bins : int or array, optional
        Resolve the pattern by depth: a number of equal bins over the slab, or
        bin edges [Å]. Adds a ``depth`` axis, after any energy axis, holding
        the pattern of the electrons generated in each bin alone -- each a
        yield of its own, one for a featureless specimen. The emission in each
        bin is recorded as ``metadata["depth_emission"]``, shaped like the
        leading axes, so that any other depth weighting ``W`` can be applied
        afterwards::

            E = np.array(patterns.metadata["depth_emission"])   # (bins,)
            pattern = np.tensordot(W * E, patterns.array, (0, 0)) / (W * E).sum()

        which with ``W = 1`` is the pattern without bins -- exactly, for a
        specimen without frozen-phonon configurations, and to within their
        spread otherwise. Slices outside the edges are left out.
    device : str, optional
        'cpu' or 'gpu'. Defaults to the user configuration.
