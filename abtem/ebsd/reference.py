"""Reference patterns: EBSD intensity over the whole hemisphere.

A single reciprocity calculation is only valid for directions near the beam
direction it was set up for, because the slab is cut with that direction along
``z`` and the propagator is accurate over a limited angle. Covering the whole
hemisphere therefore means tiling it into patches, running one calculation per
patch with its own slab, and stitching the results back together in the crystal
frame.

:class:`EBSDReferencePattern` does the tiling, the bookkeeping between the
crystal frame and each slab frame, and the stitching.

class EBSDReferencePattern(CopyMixin, EqualityMixin):
    """A hemisphere-wide EBSD reference pattern, tiled from zone-axis patches.

    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms : ase.Atoms or FrozenPhonons
        The unit cell of the crystal. Give :class:`~abtem.FrozenPhonons` of it
        for thermal vibrations -- EMsoft's Debye-Waller factor: every slab is
        displaced configuration by configuration, as the unit cell would be,
        and the pattern is the average over them, of the scattering and the
        emitting atoms alike. It costs `num_configs` times as much.
    energy : float
        Energy of the incident beam [eV].
    slab_cell : tuple of three float
        Dimensions of the slab cut for each patch [Å]; the third entry is the
        thickness along the beam. There is no default: the right size depends
        on the crystal and on how converged the pattern has to be, and a
        default is how an undersized slab goes unnoticed.

        The thickness matters most. The Kikuchi bands build up with depth, and
        a thin slab leaves them too weak to hide the small differences between
        neighbouring patches: silicon at 30 keV, 40 Å thick, breaks into facets
        along the patch boundaries around ``[101]`` -- as badly 20 Å wide as
        10 Å -- while 100 Å gives continuous bands at either width (measured
        with the original implementation's source). That implementation was
        validated at 40 x 40 x 100 Å.

        The width sets how far a wave travels before it meets a seam. A slab
        cut at an arbitrary orientation is not periodic across its faces, and
        a reciprocity wave at an angle ``θ`` to the slab's axis drifts ``θ T``
        sideways over the thickness ``T``, into the misaligned crystal beyond a
        seam, where it stops channelling. Silicon near ``[101]``, 40 Å thick,
        loses 14% of its yield 150 mrad off the slab's axis at 12 Å wide, and
        7% at 24 Å. The default 400 patches keep every direction within 90
        mrad of its slab's axis, and at 20 x 20 x 100 Å the pattern then dims
        by less than 1% towards the patch edges, averaged over the hemisphere.
        10 Å wide also swings by 12% in atom count from one patch to the next.

        To make a run cheaper, lower `gpts`, which sets how many directions are
        calculated, rather than the slab.
    n_patches : int, optional
        Number of zone-axis patches tiling each hemisphere calculated (default
        400). More patches keep every direction closer to its slab's axis, at
        the cost of more slabs.
    gpts : int, optional
        Pixels along each axis of the projected image (default 128). Only sets
        the default density of the sampled directions; the projection itself
        happens in :meth:`SphericalPattern.project`.
    projection : str or HemisphereProjection, optional
        Projection whose even grid the directions are drawn from. One of
        ``'lambert'`` (default) or ``'stereographic'``.

        Lambert is the better choice and the default for two reasons. It is
        equal-area, so it samples the hemisphere uniformly: a stereographic
        grid puts three times more directions per steradian at the equator than
        at the pole, which is the wrong way round, since the poles carry the
        zone-axis detail. And it covers the whole hemisphere including the
        near-equator azimuths that fall in the corners of its square, which a
        stereographic disk never reaches -- so a Lambert-sampled pattern can be
        interpolated to either projection without gaps, while the reverse
        leaves holes.
    sampling : float, optional
        Real-space sampling of the potentials [Å]. Defaults to
        :func:`potential_sampling` for `atoms`; the collected angles set no
        condition of their own.
    slice_thickness : float, optional
        Multislice slice thickness [Å] (default 1.0).
    direction_gpts : int, optional
        Number of points per axis of the grid the directions are drawn from.
        Defaults to ``ceil(1.15 * gpts)``, slightly denser than the output image
        so binning leaves no empty pixels.
    max_angle : float, optional
        Angular radius of each patch [mrad]: directions farther than this from
        their patch's axis are left out. Defaults to :func:`patch_half_angle`
        for `n_patches`, which leaves out none.
    repetitions : tuple of three int, optional
        Repetitions of `atoms` used to build the block the slabs are cut from.
        Defaults to the smallest block that can contain the slab at any
        orientation. Note that this also fixes which point of the crystal sits
        at the centre of each slab.
    origin : np.ndarray, optional
        Point of `atoms` to place at the centre of every slab, passed to
        :func:`rotated_slab`. Defaults to the centroid.
    hemisphere : {'north', 'south', 'both'}, optional
        Which directions to calculate (default 'north'). A centrosymmetric
        crystal needs only one: the other is its inversion image, which the
        pattern supplies wherever it is asked about it
        (:attr:`SphericalPattern.southern`). A crystal without an inversion
        centre -- GaN, GaAs -- differs between the two, and the difference is
        what an EBSD polarity measurement reads; calculate 'both' for it, at
        twice the cost. The southern directions are laid out as EMsoft lays
        them out, ``(x, y, -z)`` below each northern one.
    backscatter_energy : float or sequence of float or BaseDistribution, optional
        Energies of the backscattered electrons [eV]; several add a leading
        energy axis. See :class:`~abtem.ebsd.reciprocity.EBSD`.
    depth_weight, device :
        Passed to :class:`~abtem.ebsd.reciprocity.EBSD`.

    Notes
    -----
    Every atom emits, lit evenly, by its cross-section for scattering straight
    back (see :mod:`abtem.ebsd.emission`): the source EMsoft builds its master
    patterns from, and the one that makes a reference pattern a property of the
    crystal alone -- no incident direction singles out a patch.

    A direction ``d`` is where the backscattered electrons go. By reciprocity
    it is calculated with a plane wave travelling the other way, along ``-d``,
    into the crystal from the side the detector is on -- so the directions
    about a patch's centre are calculated in a slab cut along the opposite
    direction. For a centrosymmetric crystal the distinction makes no
    difference; for one without an inversion centre it is what puts each
    polar face in its right hemisphere.

    The intensity leaving a crystal along ``-d`` is the intensity leaving its
    inversion image along ``d``, so the southern hemisphere is calculated as
    the northern hemisphere of the crystal inverted about the origin: every
    southern patch in the slab of the northern patch opposite it, cut from the
    inverted crystal. A direction and its opposite then differ by what
    inverting the crystal changes and nothing else -- its polarity, for GaN.
    For a crystal with an inversion centre at the origin, nothing: the two
    calculations are the same.
